# zippy

A drag and drop utility for Windows to zip and encrypt files and folder. Originally built as a way to circumvent the slow load times of the WinZip GUI.

## Installation
Download and run [the installer](https://github.com/oakla/zippy/releases/download/v1.2.0/zippy-1.2.0-win64.msi). Afterwards, a shortcut icon will appear on your desktop.

## Usage

Simply drag and drop a file or folder onto the shortcut icon. You will be prompted to enter a password or allow Zippy to generate a random one for you. The zip file will be created in the same directory as the original file.
